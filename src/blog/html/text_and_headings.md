# HTML Text and Headings  

Text is one of the most fundamental elements of any webpage. In HTML, text content is structured using **paragraphs, headings, line breaks, and formatting elements** to enhance readability and accessibility.

## Paragraphs in HTML  

The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs in HTML. Each `<p>` element creates a new block of text with space before and after it.  

### Example:  

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text in HTML.</p>
<p>Each paragraph is enclosed in its own <p> tags.</p>
```

## HTML Headings (`<h1>` - `<h6>`)  

Headings in HTML help structure content and improve readability. There are **six levels of headings**, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important).  

### Why Use Headings?  

- **SEO Benefits** – Search engines prioritize `<h1>` for ranking.  
- **Accessibility** – Screen readers use headings to navigate content.  
- **Readability** – Headings break content into sections for better user experience.  

### Example:  

```html
<h1>Main Heading (Most Important)</h1>
<h2>Second-Level Heading</h2>
<h3>Third-Level Heading</h3>
<h4>Fourth-Level Heading</h4>
<h5>Fifth-Level Heading</h5>
<h6>Sixth-Level Heading (Least Important)</h6>
```

## Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules  

### Line Break (`<br>`)  

The `<br>` tag is used to insert a **line break** without creating a new paragraph. This is useful for formatting text, such as addresses or poetry.  

### Example:  

```html
<p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>
```

### Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`)  

The `<hr>` tag creates a horizontal line to separate sections of content.  

### Example:  

```html
<p>Section One</p>
<hr>
<p>Section Two</p>
```

## Text Formatting Elements  

HTML provides several tags to format text within a document.  

### Bold and Italic  

- `<b>` – Makes text bold.  
- `<strong>` – Also makes text bold but with semantic meaning for importance.  
- `<i>` – Makes text italic.  
- `<em>` – Also italicizes text but emphasizes importance.  

### Example:  

```html
<p><b>Bold Text</b> and <strong>Strong Text</strong></p>
<p><i>Italic Text</i> and <em>Emphasized Text</em></p>
```

### Underline and Strikethrough  

- `<u>` – Underlines text.  
- `<s>` – Strikes through text.  

### Example:  

```html
<p><u>Underlined text</u> and <s>Strikethrough text</s></p>
```

## Conclusion
