## Function Expressions in JavaScript  
A function expression is a way to define functions as part of an expression, often assigned to a variable.

### Example of a Function Expression  
```js
const add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

### Benefits of Function Expressions  
- Functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments.
- They are not hoisted, meaning they can’t be used before declaration.

## Arrow Functions in JavaScript  
Arrow functions provide a concise way to define functions and automatically bind `this` from the surrounding scope.

### Example of an Arrow Function  
```js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(multiply(4, 2)); // Output: 8
```

### Key Features of Arrow Functions  
- **Shorter syntax**: No need for `function` keyword.
- **Implicit return**: If there’s a single expression, the return keyword can be omitted.
- **Lexical `this` binding**: Useful in event handlers and callbacks.

### When to Use Arrow Functions  
- Great for short functions and callbacks.
- Avoid using them when you need a function with its own `this` (e.g., object methods).

## Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript  
A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

### Example: Using `map` (a Higher-Order Function)  
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squared = numbers.map(num => num * num);
console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Example: Creating a Function that Returns a Function  
```js
const createMultiplier = factor => number => number * factor;
const double = createMultiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
```

### Benefits of Higher-Order Functions  
- Enables functional programming techniques.
- Reduces code duplication.
- Improves readability and maintainability.

## Conclusion  
Understanding **function expressions, arrow functions, and higher-order functions** is essential for writing clean and efficient JavaScript. Function expressions provide flexibility, arrow functions offer concise syntax, and higher-order functions enhance modularity in code.
