## Introduction to CSS: What It Is and How It Works  
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style HTML documents. It controls the appearance of web pages, enabling developers to apply colors, layouts, fonts, and spacing effectively. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying rules that define their visual presentation.

### How CSS Works  
- CSS can be added to an HTML document in three ways: **inline styles**, **internal stylesheets**, and **external stylesheets**.
- The **cascade** determines how styles are applied when multiple rules affect the same element.
- CSS follows a **box model**, where every element is a box with properties like margin, border, padding, and content.

## Understanding CSS Selectors: A Beginner’s Guide  
Selectors are used in CSS to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. Here are some common types:

### Basic Selectors  
- **Element Selector**: Targets all elements of a specified type.  
  ```css
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```  
- **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class.  
  ```css
  .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  ```  
- **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a specific ID.  
  ```css
  #main-heading {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  ```  

## Advanced CSS Selectors: Pseudo-classes, Pseudo-elements, and Attribute Selectors  
Advanced selectors allow for more refined styling.

### Pseudo-classes  
- **`:hover`**: Applies styles when the user hovers over an element.  
  ```css
  button:hover {
    background-color: green;
  }
  ```  
- **`:nth-child(n)`**: Targets the nth child of a parent element.  
  ```css
  li:nth-child(2) {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  ```  

### Pseudo-elements  
- **`::before` and `::after`**: Add content before or after an element.  
  ```css
  p::before {
    content: "★ ";
    color: gold;
  }
  ```  

### Attribute Selectors  
- Targets elements based on their attributes.  
  ```css
  input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid gray;
  }
  ```  

## Conclusion  
CSS selectors are fundamental to web design, allowing developers to precisely target elements and apply styles. By mastering both basic and advanced selectors, you can create more dynamic and visually appealing web pages.
